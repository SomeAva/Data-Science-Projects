# portfolio-part-4


Intro - The given task was quite unique as we had to create our own questions analaysis and further provide in-depth details about our, what was done and how can different models be improved.
This project was open which means we choose our own dataset to establish and examine which gave the project a lot of room to work with


Analysis - The project was explored analysed through a variety of ways like cleaning the dataset, using a linear regression model and figuring out ways to improve it by utilising different models.
Moreover, the dataset was splitted, trained and tested to avoid overfitting and to find meaningful patterns. Different graphs like, elbow plot, histograms and scatterplots were used to
understand and visualise the data for better a better understanding and further evaluating the data and models.

Exploration:

- Importing different libraries was the first step to work with the data set and proceeding to explore the dataset
- cleaning the data was done to remove any missing or null values
- Converting categorical values to numerical with OrdEncoder as the dataset cannot work with categorical values when being trained.
- Finding the correlations between different values in relation to Life Expectancy to see the strength of the relationship
- Establishing a scatter plot to see how correlated different values when comparing to Life Expectancy.
- Using a Histogram for the univariate analysis to help and see the life expectancy and the frequency.
- Bivariate histogram used as a heatmap to see the trend with Life expectancy and GDP.
- Using a analysis technique like K-Mean clusters to minimise total cluster distance between each data point
- Splitting the dataset and further training the linear regression model
-  Doing a parameter analysis with Polynomial Regression and examine which model is better suited and having the best performance
-  Evaluating the Polynomial Regression with MAE value
-  Describing the linear regression model with MSE, R2 and MAE.

Conclusion: When configuring and examining the dataset, Machine Learning has assisted to identify patterns and making decisions which helped further improved and analysed the dataset.
Moreover, this project was completed by configuring complex models and executing different tasks with a chosen dataset
