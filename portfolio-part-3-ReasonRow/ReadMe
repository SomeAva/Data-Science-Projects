Analysis:

The presented work establishes a train and test model for both the logistic regression model and KNN model as they are essential components in machine learning. 
Moreover, it helps evaluate the given model performance and further lead to predicting and checking how accurate the data is. 
The given data was split as 90% of the data was being trained while 10% of the data was tested. The train and test values can be at
any range but should be added to the value of one.

Exploration:

• Cleansing the data was the first step by checking if any null values were presented and removing any missing values
• Converting categorical values like gender, review, category and item to numerical values using 
  Ordencoder as machine learning cannot work with categorical values like string values.
• While evaluating the data, a correlation has been studied between the assigned converted numerical values and rating to see the strength of the 
  relationship between the converted value and rating.
• Splitting the dataset once for both logistic regression and KNN models which helps as it helps evaluate the performance of the given model.
• Training the logistic regression model helps further predict the observed value and find the best weights for the regression model
• In this case, training KNN models is beneficial as labelled data can be expensive and very difficult to obtain.
  KNN can achieve accurate data with given prediction models
• The next step after splitting and training the models was to predict the data and figure out the accuracy. The accuracy goes up to the value of 1 meaning
  there are no errors in the data.
• Once receiving the accuracy value, tuning the hyper-parameter K in KNN was the next step to check how much the accuracy value has changed. 
  When tuning the K value in KNN, there was barely any difference with the accuracy value which was just 0.01.
• The final step was to visualise the data which makes it easier to understand and to highlight common trends.
  The graph gave a clear representation of the increase in K value(x-axix) led to an increase of errors for the trained model.
  while the testing model showed that as the K value increases, error decreases and over time the graph begins to flatten out.

Conclusion: WHile analysing and exploring the dataset, it helped figure out and tackle the given tasks with the
logis regression and KNN model. Furthermore, this lead to the understanding of the predicted data and how accurate it was including after the K in KNN was tuned.
