Analysis:

The main purpose of this project is to establish a a train and test model which is a fundemental step for machine learning as it allows to measure the accuracy of the data. Moreover, the dataset will be split into two sets, one is called training and the other is named testing. The training and testing can be split into a percentage of any kind but in this instance, Case 1 will train 10% of the data while Case 2 trains 90% of the data and the testing fills the rest of the remaining percentages. 

Exploration:

With the help of the linear regression model, we can establish and predict how correlated each features are in relation to rating.
- The first main step was to explore the dataset and figure out the correlation and predict the ratings for columns such as helpfulness, gender, category and review.
-  The next part was spliting the training and testing dataset with different percentages which was previously explained from the analysis.
-  Training and testing model is than begin with the regression models with cases ranging between a and d to cover the two most correlated and two least correlated features in realtion to rating
-  Evaluating the models using the mean squared error and rooted mean squared error which help measures the amount of errors and judge the models performance
-  A graph will be finally formed to compare each models and establish the prediction with the help of the MSE and RSE values which involves the training and testing models
   to confirm the most correlated features in relation to rating.

   Additional features:

   Comments are applied to guide and help the reader understand the purpose of the code and the type of imformation being retrieved.

   Challenging tasks:

- One of the challenges I have faced in this project was carefully reading and understanding what tasks is needed to complete the given work.
- Understanding a new features like Ordinal Encoder, what it does and how it will be utilised.
- Training and testing different models to ensure accuracy and reliability in the machine learning model
- figuring out the correct formula for the mean squared error as different functions/formulas can be used to caluclate the MSE value.
 
     Improvements:

- Improving the look of the graph
- enhancing the code to make it more readable
- fixing some comments to help make the code more understandable.
